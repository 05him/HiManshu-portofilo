        Hey welcome, This is HiManshu a web dev enthusiast . This is not any
        kind of informational blog in this blog I’m going to tell about my level
        zero experience for neoGCamp.<br />
        So earlier in the year 2020 I don’t know a about Tanay bhaiyaa and about
        all these so on day I was talking in a programming group on whatsapp and
        then one person told me about Tanay bhaiyaa like who’s he what he do and
        also about the neog camp . At the first impression I was amazed
        literrely I found it very helpful so I decide to prepare for neog 2020 .
        But till 2020 it was almost one year for me from leaving serious studies
        so dude to laziness and lack of dedication I missed the first chance but
        again it get opened in the January but then I was having my clg exmas
        and was using a lot of css in my one project named accent-api and due to
        all these I missed the second chance also. Now the year passes away
        neograd came up with a good job and yess then almost after 7-8 months
        here are we again . so it will be my third try but laziness and my
        missing dedication for studies made me late this time too but I’m a bit
        sure that ill do it on time . The current time is almost 11:45pm ans 30
        sep .<br />
        So wish me luck .<br />
        Hope you enjoyed reading it although nothing good is there :)
