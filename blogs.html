      <h3>1.)Hoisting</h3>
      <p>
        Hello eyeryone, this is HiManshu a web-dev enthusiast and yess this is
        my first blog.<br />
        In this blog I’m going to talk about HOISTING. For some peoples it might
        not be the new thing but for newbies like me it is a big thing.
        <br /><br />
        After listening the word hoisting, the first things come to our mind is
        what is hoisting?, how does it works?, what’s the relation with the JS?
        And many more questions, but don’t worry I’m here to tell you guys the
        best I can explain. So lets get started.<br />
        First of all Lets talk about how the Javascript file works(or compiles)
        because that’s the main part. First let me tell You that “Everything
        inside JavaScript happens inside an EXECUTION CONTEXT”, you must be
        wondering what is a EXECUTION CONTEXT, so execution context in short we
        can say is the place of execution of javascript where all the functions
        variable executions happens that particular environment is called
        Execution Context. <br />
        Further Execution Context have 2 you can say columns, the first one is
        Memory(aka variable environment) and the second one is code(aka thread
        of execution).<br />
        As the name of memory also knows variable environment clears that it is
        some relation with variable , variable environment is the execution
        space which happens before the execution of the single line of the
        javascript file, in simplest or lamest term we can say that variable
        environment is the execution space where the variables get there place
        before the execution of js code.<br />
        Initially in variable environment variables are just declared they are
        not initialized with any kind of input or data the initialization
        process occurs in the code (aka thread of execution) environment in the
        thread of execution where javascript code run synchronously line by line
        from top to bottom and then assign the values to variable line by line ,
        now before the execution of code part and after the execution of memory
        part all kind of variables holds a specific value names “undefined”.<br />
        Now lets come back to hoisting , as I said above javascript code runs
        line by line but there is one more beautiful thing inside it and that is
        we can use the variable before its initialization(not all type of
        variables) variables defined with keyword “var” can be used even before
        its initialization because var is in the same execution context of the
        program, but variable defined with keyword “let” or “const” cant be used
        before their initialization because they have a different execution
        context , but if u try to console.log a variable before its
        initialization defined with “let” or “const” then it wont show any error
        it will print the word “undefined” because as I stated above that before
        the execution of code and after the execution of memory part variable
        hold the value named “undefined”.<br />
        That’s all from my side, Hope you find it useful.<br />

      <h3>2.)Level zreo Journer</h3>
      <p>
        Hey welcome, This is HiManshu a web dev enthusiast . This is not any
        kind of informational blog in this blog I’m going to tell about my level
        zero experience for neoGCamp.<br />
        So earlier in the year 2020 I don’t know a about Tanay bhaiyaa and about
        all these so on day I was talking in a programming group on whatsapp and
        then one person told me about Tanay bhaiyaa like who’s he what he do and
        also about the neog camp . At the first impression I was amazed
        literrely I found it very helpful so I decide to prepare for neog 2020 .
        But till 2020 it was almost one year for me from leaving serious studies
        so dude to laziness and lack of dedication I missed the first chance but
        again it get opened in the January but then I was having my clg exmas
        and was using a lot of css in my one project named accent-api and due to
        all these I missed the second chance also. Now the year passes away
        neograd came up with a good job and yess then almost after 7-8 months
        here are we again . so it will be my third try but laziness and my
        missing dedication for studies made me late this time too but I’m a bit
        sure that ill do it on time . The current time is almost 11:45pm ans 30
        sep .<br />
        So wish me luck .<br />
        Hope you enjoyed reading it although nothing good is there :)
